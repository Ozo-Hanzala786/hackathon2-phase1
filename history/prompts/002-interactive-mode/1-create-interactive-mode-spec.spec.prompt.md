## Prompt

make it interactive that user can use application in one command like infinity loop

## Response snapshot

Created a comprehensive specification for interactive mode that transforms the command-line application into an interactive menu system. The spec defines three user stories: Interactive Menu Navigation (P1), Persistent Session Operations (P2), and Intuitive Interactive Controls (P3), with all required functionality to keep the application running in a loop.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created detailed feature specification for interactive mode with user stories and requirements
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: specs-history/002-interactive-mode/spec.md, checklists/requirements.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: Plan the implementation of interactive mode
- 🧠 Reflection: Specification follows template structure and covers all required sections with clear acceptance criteria

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Not applicable
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Not applicable
