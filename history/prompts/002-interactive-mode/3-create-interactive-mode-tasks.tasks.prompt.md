## Prompt

$ARGUMENTS

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive task list for implementing interactive mode with 7 phases: Setup, Foundational Components, and one phase per user story (3), plus error handling and polish. Tasks follow checklist format with proper IDs, story labels, and file paths.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created detailed implementation roadmap with 49 specific tasks
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: specs-history/002-interactive-mode/tasks.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: Begin implementation of the interactive mode
- 🧠 Reflection: Tasks are organized by user story to enable independent implementation and testing
